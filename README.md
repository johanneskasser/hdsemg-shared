# hdsemg-shared

Reusable Python components and utilities for high-density surface EMG (HD-sEMG) signal processing and input/output (I/O).

This module provides shared logic for HD-sEMG signal processing and file handling, used across multiple related projects, such as `hdsemg-pipe` and `hdsemg-select`. It is installable as a standalone Python package and is designed to simplify working with HD-sEMG data.
